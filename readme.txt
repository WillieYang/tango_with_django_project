This website is based on the Django and using some other techs, such Twitter Bootstrap, a little bit of Jquery, 
and  making use of bing web api(the latest verison) which enable user to make some serach in inside this web apps.
As for functions of this specific web site. I would update it if I have time.

It is the whole process when I reading the book Tango with Django(version 1.9.10).

If I have time, I would add a virtual enviroment about Pyhton to make this website more protable.
